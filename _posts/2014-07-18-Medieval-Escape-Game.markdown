## Project Escape Game
<br/>
>This project was carried out as part of my engineering training. The theme of the video games is: _Escape game_. This escape game was made with my friend _Hugo Lammens_ with Unity.
<br/>

### requirement and inspiration of the universe 
<br/>
>We wanted to meet these different requirements:
- Escape game including 3 rooms
- Progressive complexity of the puzzles to solve
- Progressive immersion in a medieval universe
- May the last room be majestic
- Each room had to have its own identity and uniqueness
- That the puzzles are based on observation and research

### Creation of the escape game universe
>The environment was created entirely on an apple graphic tablet. The assets were built by hand. The textures have also been designed to build certain puzzles
<br/>
<br/>
