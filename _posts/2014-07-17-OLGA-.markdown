### Synopsis
>Olga (Ольга) is a very young girl who looks very fulfilled. She comes from a loving and quite classic family, she lives in a warm house and she lacks nothing. Like all young children of her age, every day Olga discovers, learns and experiments, she experiences strong emotions and develops fears. At night, Olga finds in her dreams the elements that marked her during her day, and unfortunately, she finds her fears in her nightmares...<br/>
Do you think it's normal for children to have trouble telling the difference between their imagination and the real world? However, Olga grows up and she understands that her nightmares are real threats to her. Strange curse inherited from her ancestors, Olga must fight to survive her nightmares which can really attack her.<br/>
Dark, horrifying and deformed decors, bloodthirsty creatures, gore and disordered atmosphere, permanent feeling of anguish, this is what awaits Olga in her nightmares. She faces her worst fears during the night. To survive, Olga will have to adapt her daily life and make the right choices to prepare for the worst during her nightmares. Of course, she shouldn't make them worse by developing new fears...<br/>
Olga's bad dreams will not abruptly awaken her from her slumber but rather threaten to grip her forever in terror...

### Goal of the game
>The player must overcome his fears during his nightmares, to become stronger and overcome the curse that falls on his family.<br/>
The player can fail in the face of certain fears, which can complicate his progress. However, he must necessarily overcome his greatest fears.<br/>
The game is linear and goes through different periods of the main player's life. The player must overcome each main fear to finish the game and can only lose to 3 intermediate nightmares.

I built the whole house to make it static and usable. The elements of the house were imported from the Epic Games asset. The architecture of the house was done manually.<br/>
