description: Research project at LIARA in UQAC - Video generation with Unreal Engine, MetaHuman, and Faceware.

## MetaHuman's project 
<br/>
>This project in coordination with the LIARA research team is supervised by Yannick Francillet. It includes a team of three people. The goal is to be able to train an AI to detect bad or good placement of an elderly character practicing a sport.
This challenge involves the generation of a large dataset in photorealistic video format usable by AI. 
<br/>
<br/>
>The goal is to create a tool on UnrealEngine5 to create videos of metahumans according to these criteria:
>>_Realistic environment_<br/>
>> _Flexible and understandable facial animation_<br/>
>> _Changing scenery_<br/>
>> _Tool generating metaHumans animations_<br/>

### My role
>First my role in this project was to build a photorealistic environment. I built the entire asset there on the game engine. Then it was a question of adding the lights to make the scene lively and realistic.<br/>

>Then for the import of the metaHuman it was a question of applying an animation to it. For this I linked the animation of a mixamo dummy to the metaHuman dummy.<br/>

>Then my role is to provide tools to switch cameras in the scene. And to make a touch system that changes the texture of the environment's materials in real time<br/>
>>_Switch of camera:_
